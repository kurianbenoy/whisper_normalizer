    "\n",
    "As per the text normalization/standardization approach  Appendix Section C pp.21 the paper [Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale  Weak Supervision](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf). The `EnglishTextNormalizer` does the following functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).\n",
    "2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).\n",
    "3. Remove any of the following words: hmm, mm, mhm, mmm, uh, um\n",
    "4. Remove whitespace characters that comes before an apostrophe ’\n",
    "5. Convert standard or informal contracted forms of English into the original form.\n",
    "6. Remove commas (,) between digits\n",
    "7. Remove periods (.) not followed by numbers\n",
    "8. Remove symbols as well as diacritics from the text, where symbols are the characters with the Unicode category\n",
    "starting with M, S, or P, except period, percent, and currency symbols that may be detected in the next step.\n",
    "9. Detect any numeric expressions of numbers and currencies and replace with a form using Arabic numbers, e.g. “Ten\n",
    "thousand dollars” → “$10000”.\n",
    "10. Convert British spellings into American spellings.\n",
    "11. Remove remaining symbols that are not part of any numeric expressions.\n",
    "12. Replace any successive whitespace characters with a space."
