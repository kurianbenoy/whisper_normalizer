    "> A python package for text standardisation/normalization. It uses normalization algorithm mentioned in OpenAI whisper paper. Using Whisper normalization can cause issues in Indic languages and other low resource languages when using `BasicTextNormalizer`. So normalization in Indic languages is also implemented in this package which was derived from [indic-nlp-library](https://github.com/anoopkunchukuttan/indic_nlp_library).\n",

    "  metrics like WER, CER etc.\n",
    "- Text normalization/standardization is process of converting texts in different styles into a standardized form, which is a best-effort attempt to penalize only when a word error is caused by actually mistranscribing a word, and not by formatting or punctuation differences.(from [Whisper paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf))\n",
